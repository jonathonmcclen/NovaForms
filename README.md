Got it üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôve basically built a schema-driven form engine where:

* **`createFormHandler`** handles controlled input state + modifiers.
* **`evaluateCondition`** is the rules engine.
* **`ReturnFieldsV2`** is the renderer that decides *what UI component to show* for a given schema field type.

You‚Äôre right to think about packaging this as a library. The biggest concern isn‚Äôt *classes vs functions* (modern React is mostly function-based anyway) ‚Äî it‚Äôs **extensibility** and **developer ergonomics**.

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd approach turning this into a publishable library without a huge refactor:

---

### 1. Make field rendering pluggable

Right now, `ReturnFieldsV2` has a big `switch(type)` statement.
If a dev wants to add a new field (say `qrCodeScanner`), they‚Äôd have to **fork** your code.

üëâ Instead, turn the field registry into a map that can be extended:

```js
// core/fieldRegistry.js
const fieldRegistry = {}

export function registerField(type, component) {
  fieldRegistry[type] = component
}

export function getField(type) {
  return fieldRegistry[type]
}

export function getAllFields() {
  return { ...fieldRegistry }
}
```

Then, in your `ReturnFieldsV2`, replace the switch with:

```jsx
const FieldComponent = getField(type)

if (!FieldComponent) return null

return (
  <FieldComponent
    field={field}
    value={value}
    onChange={onChange}
    theme={mergedTheme}
  />
)
```

This lets users do:

```js
import { registerField } from 'your-lib'

registerField('qrCodeScanner', MyQrScannerComponent)
```

and now it‚Äôs available in JSON schemas with `type: 'qrCodeScanner'`.

---

### 2. Keep the handler as a utility

`createFormHandler` is already generic and doesn‚Äôt need to be a class.
You can package it as:

```js
import { createFormHandler } from 'your-lib/handlers'
```

If someone wants to override `evaluateCondition`, just let them inject it:

```js
createFormHandler({ setState, fields, evaluator: myCustomEvaluator })
```

---

### 3. Use hooks for power-users

Many React devs will expect a hook API. You can wrap your existing functions:

```js
export function useForm({ initialState = {}, fields = [] }) {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState(initialState)

  const handleChange = useMemo(
    () => createFormHandler({ setState: setFormData, fields }),
    [fields]
  )

  return { formData, setFormData, handleChange }
}
```

Now usage looks like:

```jsx
const { formData, handleChange } = useForm({ fields, initialState })

<ReturnFieldsV2
  field={field}
  value={formData[field.name]}
  onChange={handleChange}
/>
```

---

### 4. Export a theme system

You already have a `defaultTheme`. Allow users to provide their own overrides globally:

```js
let theme = defaultTheme

export function setTheme(overrides) {
  theme = { ...theme, ...overrides }
}

export function getTheme() {
  return theme
}
```

---

### 5. Packaging strategy

* Keep components in `src/fields/`
* Keep handlers in `src/handlers/`
* Keep utilities in `src/utils/`
* Barrel export from `index.js`

That way devs can `import { useForm, ReturnFieldsV2 } from 'formantic'`.

---

‚úÖ **No need to rewrite in classes.**
Your function-based approach is modern and React-idiomatic.
Just make the **registry extensible** and provide a **hook** API.

---

Would you like me to sketch out a **minimal folder + export structure** (like `src/index.ts`) so you can drop this into a library and `pnpm publish` right away?
